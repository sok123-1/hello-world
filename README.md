**Week 7**

- Using figmas generated code for my website and also using the inbuilt copilot in vs code to insert the code I created my pages.
- Added a sign in page, which was there for aesthetic purposes however was not functional just yet.
- Added a habits tracker, you can add and remove habits however it was not fully functional and convenient for the user


**Week 8**

- Worked on the colour scheme initially wanted a blue and white colour scheme but decided to go for a teal colour palette with brown coloured highlights.
- Tried to get the sign in page functional however it did not work
- Worked on the habit list made sure you could edit habits and the streak counter is accurate

**Week 9**

- Added an sql database so habits don't disappear once you leave the habits page.
- Worked on the stats page, and diary entries which is still a work in progress

**Week 10**

- Made sure that the interactivity worked between pages and continued working on diary entries, added a filter for different types of diary entries
- Continued working on the stats page, and added habit groups which are filters for your different habit groups which you can easily filter through
- Used copilot's built in software to help me fix a bug I had with all the animations in my app

  **Week 1 T4**

- Focused on changing the layout a bit to make it more user friendly
- finally fixed the sign in page so that everyone has their own private account
- Final touch ups
